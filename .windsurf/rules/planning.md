# General
- before writing any plans, please interview me to further understand the requirement. I favour multiple choice questions.  Please also look for flaws / shortcomings in any strategies I propose
- when conducting planning, break each task down into sub-tasks.  The sub-tasks should include:
    - general strategy for the sub-task
    - names of files to be created / updated
    - names and signatures of new methods
    - testing strategy for the sub-task
