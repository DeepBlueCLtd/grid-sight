# General
- before writing any plans, please interview me to further understand the requirement. 
    - I favour multiple choice questions
    - Ask me 1 question at a time.
    - Please also look for flaws / shortcomings in any strategies I propose
- when conducting planning, break each task down into sub-tasks.  The sub-tasks should include:
    - general strategy for the sub-task
    - names of files to be created / updated
    - names and signatures of new methods
    - testing strategy for the sub-task
- always allow me to review any plans before you start implementing them.
